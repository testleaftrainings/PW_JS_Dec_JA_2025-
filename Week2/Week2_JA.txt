
Q1. What is the difference between replace() and replaceAll() in test Automation?

replace() changes only the first match.
replaceAll() changes every match in the string.
In test automation, we use it when the same word/character appears many times (like commas in prices or placeholders in locators).

// Number

let price = "1,20,000";
let cleanPrice = price.replaceAll(",", "");
console.log(cleanPrice); // 120000

//String

let text = "Test Automation is Fun";
let newText = text.replaceAll(" ", "-");
console.log(newText);//Test-Automation-is-Fun

//Alphanumeric

let code = "ORD-123-123-123";
let cleaned = code.replaceAll("-", "");
console.log(cleaned); // ORD123123123

//Alphanumeric with Special Symbols

let product = "PR@#123$%45!";
let cleaned = product.replaceAll(/[^a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "");
console.log(cleaned); // PR12345


let product = "PR@#123$%45!";

// Extract only alphabets
let letters = product.replace(/[^a-zA-Z]/g, "");

// Extract only digits
let numbers = product.replace(/[^0-9]/g, "");

// Extract only special characters
let specials = product.replace(/[a-zA-Z0-9]/g, "");

console.log("Letters:", letters);     // PR
console.log("Numbers:", numbers);     // 12345
console.log("Specials:", specials);   // @#$%!

Q2. What is the difference between slice() and substring() in JS?


🔹 slice() is a JavaScript string method used to extract a part of a string (or array) and return it as a new string without changing the original one.

Syntax: slice(start, end)
Extracts characters from start index to end index.
End index is not included.
Negative indexes are allowed (count from the end).
If start > end, it returns an empty string.
Works with strings and arrays.
More powerful and flexible.

Example
let text = "Playwright";

console.log(text.slice(0, 4));   // Play
console.log(text.slice(-5));     // right
console.log(text.slice(5, 2));   // ""


🔹 substring() is a JavaScript string method used to extract characters from a string between two given indexes.

Syntax: substring(start, end)
Extracts characters between two indexes.
End index is not included.
Negative values are not allowed (treated as 0).
If start > end, it automatically swaps the values.
Works only with strings.
Simpler and safer but less flexible.

Example
let text = "Playwright";

console.log(text.substring(0, 4));  // Play
console.log(text.substring(-5));    // Playwright
console.log(text.substring(5, 2));  // ayw

Q3. What are the different types of functions in JavaScript?

🔹 1. Function Declaration / Named Function

Defined with the function keyword and has a name.
Can be called before or after declaration (As part of hoisting).

function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
greet(); // Hello, World!


🔹 2. Function Expression

A function assigned to a variable.
Not hoisted — can only be called after it’s defined.

const greet = function() {
  console.log("Hello from function expression");
};
greet();


🔹 3. Arrow Function (ES6)

A shorter syntax, commonly used in modern JS.

const greet = () => {
  console.log("Hello from arrow function");
};
greet();

Ex: const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log(add(5, 3)); // 8


🔹 4. Anonymous Function

A function without a name.
Usually used as arguments to other functions (callbacks).

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This is an anonymous function");
}, 1000);

Note:
-----
A callback function is simply a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed later (after some operation is done).

a) Simple Callback Function
------------------------


function downloadMovie(callback) {
  console.log("Downloading movie");
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Movie downloaded");
    callback(); // <-- call the function we were given
  }, 2000);
}

function playMovie() {
  console.log("Playing movie");
}

downloadMovie(playMovie);
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q4. What is a Promise in JavaScript?

A Promise is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous operation.
It tells us whether the operation is completed, successful, or failed — now or in the future.

Stages/(States) of a Promise

A Promise has 3 stages:

Stage	           Meaning
-----              --------

Pending	        Operation is still in progress
Fulfilled	Operation completed successfully
Rejected	Operation failed with an error

Example

const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve("Data loaded successfully");
  } else {
    reject("Failed to load data");
  }
});
  .then(result => console.log(result))   // Fulfilled
  .catch(error => console.log(error))    // Rejected
  .finally(() => console.log("Done"));   // Always runs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q5. What protocol is used in playwright?
Playwright uses the **Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)** and also supports its own **WebSocket-based protocol** to communicate with browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
CDP is a low-level protocol used by tools (like Playwright, Puppeteer) to control, inspect, and debug Chromium-based browsers.
It allows direct access to browser internals like **DOM**, **network**, **console**, etc.


what is websocket protocol?
WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex (two-way) communication between a client (browser) and a server over a single TCP connection.

Q6. what are the Browser Installation commands in PW.

* Install Playwright:*
  npm init playwright@latest

* Install Playwright with browsers:*
  npx playwright install
  This installs Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.

* To install Playwright package:
  npm install -D @playwright/test  //D-Dependencies

* To Execute Playwright code
  npx playwright test filename.spec.ts

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q7. what are the different browsers supported by Playwright.

"Playwright supports all major browser engines: Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, etc.), WebKit (Safari), and Firefox. This ensures true cross-browser testing with a single API.”
 Playwright is cross-browser and supports all modern rendering engines.

🔹 1. Chromium-based Browsers

 Google Chrome
 Microsoft Edge

Any Chromium-based browser (Brave, Vivaldi, Opera, etc.)

🔹 2. WebKit

Safari (Playwright runs Safari’s engine through WebKit)

🔹 3. Firefox

Supports Mozilla Firefox
It allows **cross-browser testing** with a single codebase.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q8. explain about chromium browser.

Chromium is an open-source browser project by Google, which is the base for Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and others. It uses the Blink engine and V8 JavaScript engine, making it fast and reliable.
Playwright uses Chromium for automation because it’s lightweight, open, and widely compatible.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q9.  What is test function in playwright 

The test() function in Playwright is used to define a test case and execute it using Playwright’s built-in test runner with automatic fixtures and lifecycle management.

test('verify login', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
});

Used with fixtures like `page`, `browser`, etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q10. Explain about async/await?

`async/await` is a coupled keywords to handle Promises in JavaScript.
Makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code.

* `async` keyword defines a function that returns a Promise.
* `await` pauses execution until the Promise is resolved or rejected.


async function getData() {
  const response = await fetch(url);
  console.log(response);
}

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q11. How does Playwright handle auto-waiting and retries?

Playwright auto-waits for elements to become visible, enabled, and attached to the DOM.
It also retries failed steps (like click or fill) until timeout is hit, reducing flakiness.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q12. What is the role of Browser, Context, and Page in Playwright?
 

Browser: Actual browser engine (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)

Context: Isolated environment like an incognito session

Page: A single tab within a context
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
